        "From the exploratory data analysis, I have revealed two major facts about the used car market: which are demand and price. The demand of low price used car is pretty high as compared to the to expensive ones, which highlights the customers attraction towards budget cars. But upon studying the graph I also came to know about some interesting facts about the used car market. Begining with the car companies, companies like- MG, Mercedes Benz, BMW, Volvo and KIA have the highest price but Maruti Suzuki, Hyundai, Honda, Mahindra and Tata car are in higher demand. This highlights that customer prefer to buy new luxury cars instead of used ones.\n",
        "\n",
        "Majority of the cars run either on petro or diesel, with diesel cars having slightly higher price. I also came to know that car is major player in the market. Cars with colours like white, grey, silver and black are in higher demand but exotic colors like burgundy, riviera red, dark blue, black majic have higher price. Coming to the car's odometer reading, most of the cars have reading less than 10,000 km, and cars with lower odometer reading have the higher price.\n",
        "\n",
        "Cars with bodystyle like HatchBack, SUV and Sedan are most preferred by the customers whereas the bodystyle like MPV, SUV and Sedan are the top most expensive ones. Age of the car also play a major role in its resale value. As the car age increases, it resale value decreases. Therefore, cars that age less than 5 years have higher price and prefered more. Car price also changes by location. Delhi, Maharashtra and Rajasthan are the top three states with the highes price and Car Estate, Star Auto India and Car Choice are the top three dealers with the highest price.\n",
        "\n",
        "Customers usually prefer the car with 1st owner type resulting in higher demand as well as higher price. Cars that comes with a warranty provides an assurance to the customer, resulting in a little bit higher price. The last feature i.e. Quality score also dictates the car price, where cars with higher quality score have higher price.\n",
        "\n",
        "Coming to the machine learning models, I have used Decision Tree Regressor and Random Forest Regressor to predict the car price. The Random Forest Regressor model performed better than the Decision Tree Regressor model. Moreover, from the feature importance graph, we can see that the car age, bodystyle and comapny are the key features that affect the car price."
